# -Estimating-Body-Fat-Percentage-using-Genetic-Algorithm

This project focusses on estimating Body Fat percentage using Genetic Algorithm. It includes steps which are mentioned as follows:-

1. Initilization
To solve this problem using genetic algorithm, our first step would be defining our population. So our population will contain individuals, each having their own set of chromosomes. 

2. Selection
Selecting fitest chromosomes from the population which can mate and create their off-springs.

3. Crossover
Selecting a random crossover point and the tails of both the chromosomes are swapped to produce a new off-springs.

4. Mutation
This step involves random tweak in the chromosome, which also promotes the idea of diversity in the population.

The off-springs thus produced are again validated using  fitness function, and if considered fit then will replace the less fit chromosomes from the population.
